# Hi! I'm Rubydesic ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer leveraging AI to build value and unleash the next wave of productivity. I am a generalist and I am always learning new technologies in order to stay up-to-date in the fast moving world of software development.

If you're here looking for an open-source example of my work, look no further than [Valkyrien Skies 2](https://github.com/ValkyrienSkies/Valkyrien-Skies-2), a realistic physics simulation in Minecraft with 10M+ downloads.

## Commissions

I do commissions and freelance work. Send me a friend request via Discord (@rubydesic) so we can discuss how I can help you achieve your goals. I can:

- Create and architect fullstack applications with a variety of languages and frameworks including Next.js (React), Spring Boot, .NET, and many others
- Develop purpose-built agentic AI workflows leveraging LLMs and GenAI to support high-complexity use cases involving time-consuming tasks and specialized analyses
- Implement new features and mod compatibilities into Valkyrien Skies
- And more! Don't hesitate to reach out if what you need isn't on this list
